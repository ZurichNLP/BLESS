Desmopressin is ineffective in other variants of type 2 and in type 3 VWD, and in type 2A can exacerbate thrombocytopenia. To ensure adequate response to the drug, physicians give patients a test dose and measure the response of VWF antigen. Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg given in 50 mL of 0.9 % saline solution IV over 15 to 30 minutes may enable patients to undergo minor procedures (eg, tooth extraction, minor surgery) without needing replacement therapy. For many patients, intra- nasal desmopressin may be as effective as IV treatment and is often useful to prevent bleeding during minor surgical procedures.", "references": ["For some mild forms of von Willebrand disease, drug treatment with desmopressin may be given to increase the amount of von Willebrand factor long enough for surgery or dental procedures to be done without transfusions."]}

Leukocytosis or increased levels of acute-phase reactants (eg, ESR, C-reactive protein) are nonspecific but may be used serially to monitor disease activity. To detect nutritional deficiencies, levels of vitamin D and B12 should be checked every 1 to 2 years.

Leukocytosis or increased levels of acute-phase reactants (eg, ESR, C-reactive protein) are nonspecific but may be used serially to monitor disease activity. To detect nutritional deficiencies, levels of vitamin D and B12 should be checked every 1 to 2 years. Additional laboratory measurements, such as levels of water-soluble vitamins (folic acid and niacin), fat -soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), and minerals (zinc, selenium, and copper), may be checked when deficiencies are suspected.\nSimple: No laboratory test specifically identifies Crohn disease, but blood tests may show anemia, abnormally high numbers of white blood cells, low levels of the protein albumin, and other indications of inflammation, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or level of C-reactive protein.

Sometimes there is more than one cause of the tremors.\n\nComplex: If initial presentation is less acute, an upper GI series with small- bowel follow-through and spot films of the terminal ileum is preferred over conventional CT.

Newer approaches include CT enterography or magnetic resonance enterography.\n\nComplex: After the discovery of the first case of BSE in the US on 23 December 2003, Japan halted US beef imports.\nSimple:", "model_output": "From many side effects of drugs and adverse events, patients are unable to speak or stay bedridden.

Antibiotics (usually ampicillin and an aminoglycoside âsuch as used for standard treatment of serious bacterial illness in an ill neonate) are sometimes given.\nSimple: Newborns on a ventilator may be given surfactant (a substance that coats the inside of the air sacs and allows the air sacs of the lungs to remain open) and are observed closely for serious complications, such as pneumothorax or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Newborns may also be treated with antibiotics given by vein because of the risk of an infection.\n\nComplex: However, onset may be acute, causing renal infarction with nausea, vomiting, flank pain, gross hematuria, and decreased urine output. When the cause is a hypercoagulability disorder, signs of venous thromboembolic disorders (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) may occur.\nSimple: An occasional clue to doctors is when a piece of clot breaks off and travels from the renal vein to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). This event causes sudden pain in the chest that is made worse by breathing, along with shortness of breath. In most children and a limited number of adults, onset and progression are usually sudden.\n\nComplex: In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group III), the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries.\nSimple:", "model_output": "Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) can cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries (i.e., heart disease).In patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries (i.e., heart disease).

Liver function tests should be done; elevated alkaline phosphatase and gammaâglutamyl transpeptidase levels in patients with major colonic involvement suggest possible primary sclerosing cholangitis. Leukocytosis or increased levels of acute-phase reactants (eg, ESR, C-reactive protein) are nonspecific but may be used serially to monitor disease activity. To detect nutritional deficiencies, levels of vitamin D and B12 should be checked every 1 to 2 years.

Antibiotics (usually ampicillin and an aminoglycoside âsuch as used for standard treatment of serious bacterial illness in an ill neonate) are sometimes given.\nSimple: Newborns on a ventilator may be given surfactant (a substance that coats the inside of the air sacs and allows the air sacs of the lungs to remain open) and are observed closely for serious complications, such as pneumothorax or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Newborns may also be treated with antibiotics given by vein because of the risk of an infection.\n\nComplex: However, onset may be acute, causing renal infarction with nausea, vomiting, flank pain, gross hematuria, and decreased urine output. When the cause is a hypercoagulability disorder, signs of venous thromboembolic disorders (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) may occur.\nSimple: An occasional clue to doctors is when a piece of clot breaks off and travels from the renal vein to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). This event causes sudden pain in the chest that is made worse by breathing, along with shortness of breath. In most children and a limited number of adults, onset and progression are usually sudden.\n\nComplex: In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group III), the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries.\nSimple:", "model_output": "We do not completely understand what causes these changes in pulmonary arteries. Hypoxia is not present and the pulmonary arteries become stiff and narrowed. The lungs, the largest muscles in the body, receive less blood. Patients have difficulty breathing. The shortness of breath often becomes worse with exercise.A CT scan can visualize more of the lung, with slightly less radiation exposure than a CT scan. This is a good test when other conditions are suspected.", "source": "In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group III), the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries.", "references": ["Treatment for hypoxic and miscellaneous varieties of pulmonary hypertension have not been established."]}

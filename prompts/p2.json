You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence needs to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.",
